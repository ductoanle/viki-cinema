				<p>An elite division of law enforcement goes after criminals who can’t always be seen or found. Kim Woo Hyun (So Ji Sub) is the son of a high-ranking police official who graduated from the police academy at the top of his class. He now works in the cyber investigation department of the police force. But while trying to track down super hacker Park Gi Young (Daniel Choi), Woo Hyun appears to be involved in some shady dealings with some powerful people. When a warehouse accident wipes out two lives, the hacker assumes the identity of Woo Hyun and is determined to investigate what the former Woo Hyun was up to. With the help of fellow cyber-detective Yoo Kang Mi (Lee Yeon Hee), who has an online reputation for being an “uljjang” (good-looking), and geeky Internet expert Jo Hyun Min (Uhm Ki Joon), can the new Woo Hyun discover the truth? “Ghost” is a 2012 South Korean drama series directed by Kim Hyeong Sik.</p></div><div class="buttons"><button class="btn btn-watch">Watch Now</button></div></li> -->
